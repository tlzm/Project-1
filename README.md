# Reinforcement learning application

Double DQN, DDPG for VCE aero-engine self-optimization fuel consumption (based on TF1)

This is  a deep learning self-optimization application base on VCE aero-engine model. The model is from XXX institude and cannot be published.

As a result, the reinforcement learning get better results in optimization problems. However, the stablity and robustness is not enough for the complex control environment in my experiments. Maybe it's a better choice to used as a pid parameters selection or auxiliary control systems.
